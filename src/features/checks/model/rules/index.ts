/**
 * The rule registry.
 *
 * Adding a check is adding a module here and a line below. Nothing in the parser changes, nothing
 * in the components changes, and no existing rule is touched - which is the property the whole
 * layer exists to have.
 *
 * Order is display order within a group. The generator's own warnings come first because they are
 * what the report itself said; everything after them is the dashboard's reading.
