 * to the configuration value. This is the phase-node half of that, and it is deliberately a count
 * plus a glyph rather than a sentence - the row it sits in is already carrying a status, a counter
 * and a duration.
 *
 * Not mounted by the spine today; the spine's own files belong to another plan. Any view holding a
 * phase id can drop it in.
