/**
 * Every crossing point between the pipeline spine and a report view.
 *
 * Two jobs, deliberately in one file. It maps a report section id to the view that renders it, so
 * a report hangs from the phase it describes rather than from a navigation tab. And it is the ONLY
 * place the shell names another feature's module path, so when a view moves there is exactly one
 * import to change instead of a search across the spine.
 *
 * Three rules the mapping has to keep:
 *
 *   A view may serve several sections. The release comparison is assembled from `prev_lib` AND
 *   `other_reports`, so both ids resolve to the same renderer and the caller de-duplicates by
 *   `key` - the spine must not mount one view twice on one phase.
 *
 *   An unmapped section still renders. Anything without a specialised view falls through to the
 *   generic renderer, which is what makes an unfamiliar future section visible instead of lost.
 *
 *   Every view is lazy. A report is only fetched when the phase that owns it is opened, and the
 *   shell renders without waiting on any of them.
