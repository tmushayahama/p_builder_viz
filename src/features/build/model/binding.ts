/**
 * The section-to-phase binding registry.
 *
 * The pipeline is the spine of the experience, so reports hang from the phase they describe
 * rather than forming a navigation model that mirrors `sections[].id`. This registry is the one
 * place that relationship is written down. It supports many sections per phase and one section
 * contributing to several phases, and it reads an optional per-section phase hint first so the
 * binding can become data-driven later without a model change.
 *
 * Anything unmapped collects under `UNATTACHED_PHASE_ID` at the end of the spine. Unknown future
 * sections are surfaced there, never hidden.
