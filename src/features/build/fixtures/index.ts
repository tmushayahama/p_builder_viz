/**
 * The named fixture-state catalog.
 *
 * A state is a recipe over the real report, not a separate file: `transforms` names the steps and
 * `build()` applies them. Both the state and its parsed report are memoised per key, so a state is
 * parsed once per session rather than once per render, and the memoisation keys on the recipe
 * rather than on a component's identity.
